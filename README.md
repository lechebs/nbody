# Numerical N-Body Solution
## Introduction
In an n-body problem, we need to find the positions and velocities of a collection of
interacting particles over a period of time. For example, an astrophysicist might want
to know the positions and velocities of a collection of stars, while a chemist might
want to know the positions and velocities of a collection of molecules or atoms. An
n-body solver is a program that finds the solution to an n-body problem by simulating
the behavior of the particles.

## First formulation
We started our developing from an n-body solver that simulates the motions
of planets or stars.<br />
That is, the force excerted on particle $`q`$ by particle $`p`$ is given by
```math
\vec{f}_{q,p}(t)=-G\frac{m_qm_p}{\left|\vec{s}_q(t)-\vec{s}_p(t)\right|^3}\left[\vec{s}_q(t)-\vec{s}_p(t)\right]
```
where $`G`$ is the Gravitational constant ($`\approx 6.7\times 10^{âˆ’11}`$)<br/><br/>
The total force acting on a particle is therefore
```math
\vec{F}_q(t)=\sum_{i\neq q}^{N}\vec{f}_{q,i}(t)
```
From Newton's second law, we can compute the particles acceleration as
```math
\vec{a}_q(t) = \frac{\vec{F}_q(t)}{m_q}
```
Using a first-order integration scheme (in this case Forward Euler) we can compute the updated velocities and positions at time $`t+\Delta t`$
```math
\vec{s}_q(t+\Delta t)\approx \vec{s}_q(t)+\Delta t\vec{v}_q(t)
```
```math
\vec{v}_q(t+\Delta t)\approx \vec{v}_q(t)+\Delta t\vec{a}_q(t)
```

## Optimizations
### Computation of forces
Using Newton's third law, we can halve the amount of forces computed, since
```math
\vec{f}_{p,q}(t)=-\vec{f}_{q,p}(t)
```
### Better integration Scheme
The Forward Euler scheme, being first-order, performs bad in terms of accuracy when the $`\Delta t`$ is not extremely small. 
It's therefore crucial to choose a better integration scheme for the computation of the velocities and positions.<br />
As a first optimization, we used a Leapfrog KDK scheme, which is second order, and is composed as follows:
```math
\vec{v}_q(t+\frac{\Delta t}{2}) = \vec{v}_q(t)+\vec{a}_q(t)\frac{\Delta t}{2}
```
```math
\vec{s}_q(t+\Delta t) = \vec{s}_q(t) + \Delta t \vec{v}_q(t+\frac{\Delta t}{2})
```
```math
\vec{v}_q(t+\Delta t) = \vec{v}_q(t+\frac{\Delta t}{2})+\vec{a}_q(t+\Delta t)\frac{\Delta t}{2}
```
